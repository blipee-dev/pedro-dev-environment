# ðŸš€ Copy-Paste Deployment (Super Easy!)

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Click this link**: [Create Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. **Copy and paste these details**:
   - Repository name: `pedro-dev-environment`
   - Description: `ðŸš€ One-command setup for elite development environment - Multi-workstation productivity toolkit`
   - Make it **Public** âœ…
   - **Don't check any boxes** (we have our own files)
3. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy-Paste Commands (30 seconds)

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username in the commands below.

Open Terminal and copy-paste these commands one by one:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd ~/Documents/pedro-dev-environment

# Add your GitHub repository (REPLACE YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pedro-dev-environment.git

# Push everything to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Test Your Elite Environment (1 command)

**After Step 2 is complete**, test the magic (replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME):

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pedro-dev-environment/main/setup.sh | bash
```

## Example with Username "pedro":
If your GitHub username is "pedro", your commands would be:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/pedro-dev-environment
git remote add origin https://github.com/pedro/pedro-dev-environment.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Test command:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedro/pedro-dev-environment/main/setup.sh | bash
```

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your elite development environment is now deployable on any workstation with one command!
