# üöÄ Blipee Toolpad - Elite Development Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the **world-class development workflow** for the Blipee Toolpad project, leveraging our **elite-tier development environment** for maximum productivity and code quality.

## üéØ DAILY DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### 1. Morning Startup Routine
```bash
# Navigate to project
projects && cd blipee/blipee-toolpad

# üöÄ AUTOMATED STARTUP (Recommended)
blipee start               # Complete environment setup (includes auto-tidy + dev server + Claude IDE)

# OR Manual startup (if preferred)
cide &                     # Start Claude Code IDE
blipee tidy               # Quick cleanup of build artifacts and logs
gs                        # Git status  
ll                        # Beautiful file listing
dev                       # npm run dev with hot reload
```

### 2. AI-First Feature Development

#### Phase 1: Planning with Claude Code
```bash
# Start interactive Claude session
cc

# Example AI-assisted planning:
# "I need to implement user authentication. Can you help me plan the architecture?"
# "What's the best approach for state management in this project?"
# "How should I structure the API endpoints for user management?"
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation Strategy
1. **Architecture Discussion**: Use Claude Code to design the feature architecture
2. **File Structure**: Get AI recommendations for optimal file organization
3. **Technology Selection**: Discuss best libraries/frameworks for the task
4. **Testing Strategy**: Plan comprehensive test coverage

#### Phase 3: Rapid Development
```bash
# Create new feature branch
gcb feature/user-auth       # git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# Use dual AI assistance:
# - Claude Code: Architecture, complex logic, problem-solving
# - GitHub Copilot: Code completions, repetitive patterns

# Example workflow:
# 1. Ask Claude: "Generate the user authentication component structure"
# 2. Use Copilot: For quick implementations and boilerplate
# 3. Use Error Lens: Real-time error detection and fixes
```

## üîß DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES

### Code Quality Workflow
1. **Real-time Quality Assurance**:
   - Error Lens shows issues inline as you type
   - Prettier formats code automatically on save
   - ESLint auto-fixes common issues
   - Import Cost monitors bundle size impact

2. **AI-Powered Code Review**:
   ```bash
   # Before committing, use Claude Code for review
   cc
   # "Please review this code for potential issues, optimization opportunities, and best practices"
   ```

3. **STRICT Quality Enforcement**:
   ```bash
   # Pre-development quality check
   blipee pre-dev          # Enforces documentation-first + 95% coverage + 100% test pass
   
   # Traditional quality checks (if not using automation)
   lint                    # Run ESLint with auto-fix
   test                    # Run test suite  
   build                   # Verify build succeeds
   
   # Check current test coverage status
   blipee coverage         # Shows coverage analysis and improvement suggestions
   ```

### Git Workflow with Premium Tools

#### üöÄ AI-Assisted Commit Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
# Check status and stage changes
gs                      # Check status (short format)
gd                      # View diff with delta (syntax highlighted)

# AI-powered commit with STRICT quality enforcement
blipee smart-commit     # Analyzes changes + generates commit messages + enforces quality gates

# OR Enhanced commit workflow 
blipee commit "feat: add user authentication with JWT"  # Strict quality enforcement

# Push with safety checks
blipee push             # Safe push with pre-push validation
```

#### Manual Git Workflow (Traditional)
```bash
# Check project status
gs                      # Status (short format)
gd                      # View diff with delta (syntax highlighted) 
ga .                    # Stage changes
gcm "feat: add user authentication with JWT"  # Commit with message
gp                      # Push to remote

# For complex Git operations
lazygit                 # Beautiful terminal Git UI

# View project history
glog                    # Beautiful commit graph
```

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

### AI-Generated Testing
1. **Use Claude Code to generate comprehensive tests**:
   ```bash
   cc
   # "Generate unit tests for the UserAuth component including edge cases"
   # "Create integration tests for the authentication API endpoints"
   # "Generate E2E tests for the login/logout flow"
   ```

2. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Write tests with AI assistance before implementation
   - Use Error Lens to see test results in real-time
   - Achieve high coverage with AI-generated test cases

### Testing Commands
```bash
test                    # Run all tests
test --watch           # Watch mode for development
test --coverage        # Generate coverage report
test auth              # Run specific test suites
```

## üì¶ PACKAGE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Modern Package Management with pnpm
```bash
# Installation (2x faster than npm)
pnpm install           # Install dependencies
pnpm add react-query   # Add new dependency
pnpm add -D vitest     # Add dev dependency

# Version management with fnm
fnm list              # List available Node versions
fnm use 18            # Switch to Node 18
fnm install 20        # Install Node 20
```

### Dependency Analysis
- **Import Cost**: Monitor bundle size impact in real-time
- **AI Analysis**: Use Claude Code to evaluate dependency choices
- **Security**: Regular dependency audits

   bat src/auth.js       # View files with syntax highlighting
   ```

3. **Git-Powered Debugging**:
   ```bash
   # Find when a bug was introduced
   glog --oneline -10    # Recent commits
   lazygit               # Visual Git operations
   
   # Use GitLens in VS Code:
   # - Blame annotations

   bat package.json      # Review dependencies
   rg "TODO"             # Find pending tasks
   tree --level=3        # Project structure overview
   ```

## üßπ WORKSPACE MAINTENANCE

### Daily Cleanup Automation
```bash
# Morning startup includes automatic cleanup
blipee start            # Auto-tidy during startup

# Real-time cleanup during development
blipee watch            # Continuous cleanup of .DS_Store and temp files
```

### Weekly Maintenance
```bash
# Comprehensive workspace cleanup
blipee clean --dry-run  # Preview what would be cleaned
blipee clean            # Guided cleanup (Level 1 + Level 2)

# Deep analysis and optimization
blipee clean --deep     # All 3 levels + unused dependency analysis

# Quick cleanup anytime
blipee tidy             # Fast Level 1 cleanup (build artifacts, logs, cache)
```

### Cleanup Benefits
- **Always clean workspace**: Build artifacts and logs automatically removed
- **Optimized disk usage**: Cache directories and temp files cleaned
- **Dependency analysis**: Unused packages and orphaned files detected
- **Git-aware safety**: Never deletes tracked files without permission
- **Smart detection**: Framework-aware cleanup (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
